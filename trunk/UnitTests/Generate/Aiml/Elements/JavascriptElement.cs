    /// Contents of external processor elements may consist of character data as well as AIML 
    /// template elements. If AIML template elements in the contents of an external processor 
    /// element are not enclosed as CDATA, then the AIML interpreter is required to substitute 
    /// the results of processing those elements before passing the contents to the external 
    /// processor. As a trivial example, consider: 
    ///
    /// &lt;system&gt; 
    ///
    ///     echo '&lt;get name="name"/&gt;'

    /// AIML 1.0.1 does not require that any contents of an external processor element are 
    /// enclosed as CDATA. An AIML interpreter should assume that any unrecognized content is 
    /// character data, and simply pass it to the appropriate external processor as-is, following 
    /// any processing of AIML template elements not enclosed as CDATA. 
    ///
    /// If an external processor is not available to process the contents of an external processor 
    /// element, the AIML interpreter may return an error, but this is not required.
