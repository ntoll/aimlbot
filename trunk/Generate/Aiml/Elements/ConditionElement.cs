    /// The condition element instructs the AIML interpreter to return specified contents depending 
    /// upon the results of matching a predicate against a pattern. 
    /// 
    /// NB: The condition element has three different types. The three different types specified 
    /// here are distinguished by an xsi:type attribute, which permits a validating XML Schema 
    /// processor to validate them. Two of the types may contain li elements, of which there are 
    /// three different types, whose validity is determined by the type of enclosing condition. In 
    /// practice, an AIML interpreter may allow the omission of the xsi:type attribute and may instead 
    /// heuristically determine which type of condition (and hence li) is in use. 
    /// 
    /// Block Condition 
    /// ---------------
    /// 
    /// The blockCondition type of condition has a required attribute "name", which specifies an AIML 
    /// predicate, and a required attribute "value", which contains a simple pattern expression. 
    ///
    /// If the contents of the value attribute match the value of the predicate specified by name, then 
    /// the AIML interpreter should return the contents of the condition. If not, the empty string "" 
    /// should be returned.
    /// 
    /// Single-predicate Condition 
    /// --------------------------
    /// 
    /// The singlePredicateCondition type of condition has a required attribute "name", which specifies 
    /// an AIML predicate. This form of condition must contain at least one li element. Zero or more of 
    /// these li elements may be of the valueOnlyListItem type. Zero or one of these li elements may be 
    /// of the defaultListItem type.
    /// 
    /// The singlePredicateCondition type of condition is processed as follows: 
    ///
    /// Reading each contained li in order: 
    ///
    /// 1. If the li is a valueOnlyListItem type, then compare the contents of the value attribute of 
    /// the li with the value of the predicate specified by the name attribute of the enclosing 
    /// condition. 
    ///     a. If they match, then return the contents of the li and stop processing this condition. 
    ///     b. If they do not match, continue processing the condition. 
    /// 2. If the li is a defaultListItem type, then return the contents of the li and stop processing
    /// this condition.
    /// 
    /// Multi-predicate Condition 
    /// -------------------------
    /// 
    /// The multiPredicateCondition type of condition has no attributes. This form of condition must 
    /// contain at least one li element. Zero or more of these li elements may be of the 
    /// nameValueListItem type. Zero or one of these li elements may be of the defaultListItem type.
    /// 
    /// The multiPredicateCondition type of condition is processed as follows: 
    ///
    /// Reading each contained li in order: 
    ///
    /// 1. If the li is a nameValueListItem type, then compare the contents of the value attribute of 
    /// the li with the value of the predicate specified by the name attribute of the li. 
    ///     a. If they match, then return the contents of the li and stop processing this condition. 
    ///     b. If they do not match, continue processing the condition.

    /// Condition List Items
    /// 
    /// As described above, two types of condition may contain li elements. There are three types of 
    /// li elements. The type of li element allowed in a given condition depends upon the type of that 
    /// condition, as described above.
